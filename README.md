# Unit-converter
 
Scrimba's Unit-converter Solo Project solution. The unit converter transforms numbers from metric to imperial units. When a number is typed into the input field and the convert button is clicked, the length in meters and feet, volume in liters and gallons, and mass in kilograms and pounds are generated.
